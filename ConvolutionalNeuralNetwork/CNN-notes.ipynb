    "a) Draw weights from a distribution with zero mean and a specific variance\n",

    "Learning Rate - Defines step size during gradient descent\n",
    "Batch Size - Batches allow us to use stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "Smaller- less representative of data\n",
    "Larger - Longer training time\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    " Overfitting - Works perfect on Training set and test data is not performed well\n",
    " \n",
    " Possibility of overfitting too high. \n",
    " to mitigate\n",
    " a) L1/L2 regularisation - Add penalty for larger weights in the model and not unique to neural networks\n",
    " b) Dropout - Unique to Neural netowrks, remove nuerons during training randomly, Network doesn't over rely on any particular neuron\n",
    " c) Expanding data - Artifically expand data by adding noise, Tilt images, adding low white noise to sound data etc. "
